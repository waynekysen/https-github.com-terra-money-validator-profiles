About Kysen Technologies
Meet KysenPool -- Global Proof-of-Stake Validator experienced operating nodes for Cardano (ADA), Cosmos (ATOM), Terra (LUNA), Harmony (ONE), Kava (KAVA) and Desmos (DSM).
 We are responsible for well over $300M USD worth of tokens delegated across our validators. Our infrastructure is a hybrid of data centres (with Hardware Security Modules / HSMs), and multiple Cloud providers. Our mission is to help decentralize the Proof-of-Stake blockchain ecosystem. We're highly familiar with the Tendermint-based blockchains such as Cosmos, Terra, Kava and Desmos; EVM-compatible Layer-1 chains like Harmony; and complex setups with Cardano. Our team is located around the world to improve our operations and building insights for the chains we support.
